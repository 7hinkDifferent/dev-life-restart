# Developer Life Restart Game Project Structure

The project structure of the Developer Life Restart game is organized into several key directories with a modular architecture pattern. The main components and organization are defined as follows:

## Directory Structure

The root directory contains the following key folders: [1](#2-0) 

The main source code is contained in the `src` directory, which is organized into the following subdirectories: [2](#2-1) 

## Core Architecture

The game follows a modular architecture where the `Life` class serves as the central controller that coordinates all other modules. This class is defined in `src/modules/life.js` and it integrates the core game modules: [3](#2-2) 

The game defines its modules and functions in a structured way: [4](#2-3) 

## Entry Points

The main entry point of the application is `src/index.js`, which initializes the global event system and creates instances of the core classes: [5](#2-4) 

The `App` class in `src/app.js` handles application initialization, loading resources, and UI setup: [6](#2-5) 

## Module Dependencies

The main game logic is controlled by the `Life` class, which depends on several other modules: [7](#2-6) 

## UI Architecture

The UI system uses a layered approach managed by the `UIManager` class: [8](#2-7) 

The UI is divided into three main layers: [9](#2-8) 

The available pages and components are defined in `views.js`: [10](#2-9) 

## Theming System

The project supports multiple themes (cyber, dark, light) that change the visual appearance of the game: [11](#2-10) [12](#2-11) [13](#2-12) 

## Notes

The Developer Life Restart game uses Laya UI engine for rendering the interface and follows a clear separation between game logic (in the modules directory) and the UI representation. The architecture allows for different themes and both web and command-line versions of the game as indicated in the README.

The data for the game is loaded dynamically from JSON files, which are converted from XLSX files during the build process (as mentioned in the README instructions).
